# Blizzard
This app is for testing the blizzard API, to see what information is being thrown back to me, and that will drive the purpose of the app.

My original goal was to make a 'homebase' app that would give you small snippets of your data from each blizzard game(diablo, hearthstone, wow, over watch) But upon seeing that call of duty was hosted by battlenet, I am excited to see if I can get into that data from the API.
